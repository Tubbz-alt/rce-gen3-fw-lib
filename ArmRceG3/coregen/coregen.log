WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'zynq_icon' for IP 'ICON (ChipScope
   Pro - Integrated Controller) v1.06.a' was generated with a different version
   of the IP than is currently in the IP Catalog. It was originally generated
   using IP with the packaged timestamp '2012-07-21+03:11'; the IP in the
   current catalog has a different packaged timestamp '2013-03-26+22:44'. This
   mismatch is due to changes made to the IP in the user repositories. It may
   affect some functionality of the IP, if there are differences between these
   two versions of the IP.
WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'zynq_ila' for IP 'ILA (ChipScope Pro
   - Integrated Logic Analyzer) v1.05.a' was generated with a different version
   of the IP than is currently in the IP Catalog. It was originally generated
   using IP with the packaged timestamp '2012-07-21+03:12'; the IP in the
